									<h1>I am<br />
									Lalit Madhav Viyyapu</h1>
									<p>I am an analytical and data-driven problem solver, soon to graduate in May 2025 with a Master of Science in Information Technology and Management from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). Building upon a foundational Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from GITAM School of Technology (May 2021), my graduate studies have provided me with a strong command of data analysis techniques, business intelligence concepts, predictive modeling, and strategic IT application. My technical skills include proficiency in Python, R, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tableau, Power BI, ETL Pipelines, Data Warehousing, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP (BigQuery).</p>
									<p>Complementing my education, I gained professional experience during a eight-month role from January 2023 to August 2023 as a Junior Application Analyst at 9Pack Software Pvt Ltd. This experience involved providing technical support and troubleshooting for the Virtual Tech application, working with internal teams to identify and resolve application issues, monitoring application performance, analyzing logs, and optimizing system efficiency. This role honed my problem-solving abilities, technical troubleshooting skills, and collaboration with stakeholders to bridge technical and business needs.</p>
									<p>My portfolio showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my practical application of analytical and technical skills highly relevant to data roles. These include developing Machine Learning models in R, performing Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis in Python, and building an Online Data Management Storage System utilizing SQL, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, and Power BI. I also conducted in-depth research and analysis for a paper on The Economic Impacts of Nurse Staffing on Hospital Financial Results and developed a comprehensive Marketing Strategy involving market research and strategic planning. My projects collectively cover data preprocessing, statistical modeling, visualization, database management, cloud data platforms, BI tools, research, and strategic analysis. Please check out a few of my <a href="index.html">projects</a> to see these skills in action.</p>

									<p>Through this diverse portfolio, I have gained hands-on experience across the data lifecycle and in applying analytical thinking to real-world problems. With a solid foundation in technical analysis from my Bachelor's, advanced data and strategy knowledge from my ITM Master's, practical professional experience, and a robust project portfolio, I am well-prepared for data-focused roles. I am eager to apply my skills as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or BI Analyst to extract meaningful insights, develop data-informed strategies, and contribute to impactful business decisions.</p>
									<p>Please explore my portfolio to see examples of my analytical and strategic work. I welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how my skills align with your team's needs.</p>								</header>
