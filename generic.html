									<h1>I am<br />
									Lalit Madhav Viyyapu</h1>
									<p>I am a motivated and determined professional with a passion for data analysis and a strong background in software development . With over two years of experience as an Associate Software Developer at 9Pack Software Pvt Ltd, I have cultivated expertise in troubleshooting, software maintenance, and key technologies such as PostgreSQL.</p>
									<p>My professional journey has taught me how to thrive in a fast-paced environment. I've developed crucial communication skills and a deep understanding of organizational behavior, which has enabled me to consistently progress and adapt. During my time at 9Pack, I contributed to the design and optimization of scalable enterprise applications, building and maintaining modules using Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL. I also gained valuable experience with cloud platforms, supporting deployments on Microsoft Azure and Microsoft App Center, and performed root cause analysis to resolve performance issues.</p>
									<p>My portfolio showcases a range of projects that demonstrate my practical application of analytical and technical skills highly relevant to data roles. These include developing Machine Learning models in R, performing Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis in Python, and building an Online Data Management Storage System utilizing SQL, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, and Power BI. I also conducted in-depth research and analysis for a paper on The Economic Impacts of Nurse Staffing on Hospital Financial Results and developed a comprehensive Marketing Strategy involving market research and strategic planning. My projects collectively cover data preprocessing, statistical modeling, visualization, database management, cloud data platforms, BI tools, research, and strategic analysis. Please check out a few of my <a href="index.html">projects</a> to see these skills in action.</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/self img.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Through this diverse portfolio, I have gained hands-on experience across the data lifecycle and in applying analytical thinking to real-world problems. With a solid foundation in technical analysis from my Bachelor's, advanced data and strategy knowledge from my ITM Master's, practical professional experience, and a robust project portfolio, I am well-prepared for data-focused roles. I am eager to apply my skills as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or BI Analyst to extract meaningful insights, develop data-informed strategies, and contribute to impactful business decisions.</p>
									<p>Please explore my portfolio to see examples of my analytical and strategic work. I welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how my skills align with your team's needs.</p>
